Venue: Leipzig University Library  
Dates: Sept. 12-13, 2017

## Description

Whether it is meta-data or data-based research projects, videogames and videogame culture confront us with many challenges in fields like videogame data management, metadata, authority files and data-driven videogame research. Organized collaboratively by the diggr-project (<http://diggr.link>{.external}) and the exchange project “Japan’s videogames between the local and the global”, the international workshop “Japan’s Videogame Culture Data I” aims to discuss these challenges - bringing together experts from various places and disciplines to think about ways to overcome them collaboratively.

The workshop will feature a series of 20min presentations on ongoing projects, followed by q&a, during the public event on Sept. 12th. The second day will be non-public and focuses on discussing common ground and possible collaborations.

The workshop is made possible with funding from the DFG and the DAAD.

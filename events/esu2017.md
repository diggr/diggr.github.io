If you'd like to participate in our workshop “Extract, Map, Load, Repeat: A Data Workout” please be advised to read the following instructions and information carefully.

A computer is essential to follow the exercises. For the duration of the workshop, every participant can be provided with a computer to work with. Yet the machines that can be provided have limited resources, and might not be the best performing when working with extremely resource-hungry tools like _Karma_. Therefore it is advised to install [_Karma - Data Integration Tool_](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/karma/) on your personal computer.

Please [obtain the latest release from the official website (free of charge)](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/releases) and follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/wiki/Installation%3A-One-Click-Install). If you don't manage to make Karma run on your computer, don't hesitate to ask us for assistance. Again: you can participate in the workshop by using one of the computers we can provide you with.
